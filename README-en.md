Recipes, analyses and other cooking notes
-----------------------------------------

I like to experiment with recipes, aiming to find the best possible cheesecake,
cookies etc. This is the place where I keep my notes, trying to make them
accurate and reproducible. Hopefully one day this will become a complete
cookbook :-)

How to use this
---------------

* each directory is a separate recipe
* the official version of a recipe is in `README.md`
* log of all experiments (and their results) related to a recipe is in
  `analizy.md`
* list of research topics is in `todo.md`

About English translation
-------------------------

The primary language of this repo (unlike every other one I own) is Polish.
That's because cooking is quite region-specific (at least in my experience -
when I tried to bake my flagship cheesecake in US, I just couldn't get right
ingredients - everything was different than in Poland). However, I'm open to
providing translations of the recipes :-)

Contributing
------------

* please open an issue if something is not clear.
* I'm happy to accept pull requests with suggestions and translations.
* it would be delightful if you tried experimenting with the recipes and shared
  your results!
