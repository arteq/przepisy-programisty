Geeky recipes
-------------

This repo is my cookbook. The aim is to make it as precise as possible, so that
anyone following the recipes will be able to reproduce my (excellent, according
to my friends and colleagues) results _exactly_. Additionally, I want to
explore how proportions of ingredients and particular ways of doing things
influence the final result, to get a deep understanding of how each recipe
works. This will help with troubleshooting (if anyone tries the recipe and
won't get the same results).

About English translation
-------------------------

The primary language of this repo (unlike every other one I own) is Polish.
That's because cooking is quite region-specific (at least in my experience -
when I tried to bake my flagship cheesecake in US, I just couldn't get right
ingredients - everything was different than in Poland). However, I'm open to
providing translations of the recipes :-)

Why GitHub??
------------

* I want to track how recipes evolve
* I want a mechanism to discuss improvements in recipes (Pull Requests!)
* I want to make it easy for others to suggest changes (Open Source!)
* It's fun, and a geeky thing to do!
